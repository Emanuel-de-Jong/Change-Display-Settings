## Backstory
Back in 2019, I made a script to quickly change the resolution and refresh rate of a monitor back and forth because I needed to switch often for a game. Then in 2021 I made another script because I wanted to change display orientation using something easily executable without needing to recompile. I decided to go with console flags and batch files. That script however didn't have the resolution and refresh rate functionality.

Now I'm here for the third time wanting something with the functionality of script 1 and the ease of script 2. So I decided to go all out and combine them in a clean way.
